                because it is no real "web" client. It is a webpage that downloads your password over the local network 
                (Wi-Fi) using JavaScript. So your data never leaves your network! While the data is exchanged between 
                the web application and Castle it is encrypted with your password and a pin displayed by Castle. That

                To bypass this problem Castle uses HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. This allows Castle to use 
                HTTPS. But again most browsers do not want self-signed certificates because of security reasons. 
                That is why you have to open a page served by Castle which is signed with the self-signed certificate. 
                When you do this you say the browser "Please accept this certificate. It is secure". After you have
