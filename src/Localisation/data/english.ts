                    put into one group. They are offline or online ones. Onlines password managers have 
                    the great benefit that users can access their passwords from everywhere, while 
                    offline password managers are more private because you do not have to trust a 
                    company that they do not read your passwords. Castle combines both worlds! Your 
                    passwords are always offline on your device, but you can still share them very
                    easy over your local network (Wi-Fi).`
